# Snake Game

This is a project I did in my AP Computer Science class. I enjoyed building the snake game because I got to play around with many new tools in Python Tkinter.


### How I did it:

Snake game is a classic game I enjoyed ever since I was a kid. 

While I built the game, I encountered many bugs and strange glitches, such as the snake only moving when there were computer inputs, or leaving its body parts behind. To troubleshoot, I work backwards. First, I see what are the possible parts of my code that could cause that error, and then check each one of them to see if there are anything strange with it.

Finally, I enhanced the look and feel of the game by adding Labels, changing the colors for aesthetics.

### What I learned:

In this project, I used the Python Tkinter library, threading, and a few others.

What stands out:
I added a unique feature for fun; If you press r, you can break off from your body to start a new snake!
